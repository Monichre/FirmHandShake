          The intense veneration with which relics were regarded, however,
          caused them to be generally adopted as the most effective means of
          adding security to oaths, and so little respect was felt for the
          simple oath that, ere long, the adjuncts came to be looked upon as the
          essential feature, and the imprecation itself to be divested of
          binding force without them. Thus, in 680, when Ebroin, mayor of the
          palace of Burgundy, had defeated Martin, Duke of Austrasia, and
          desired to entice him from his refuge in the stronghold of Laon, two
          bishops were sent to him bearing the royal reliquaries, on which they
          swore that his life should be safe. Ebroin, however, had astutely
          removed the holy remains from their cases in advance, and when he thus
          got his enemy in his power, he held it but a venial indiscretion to
          expose Martin to a shameful death.

          It was late when the day scholars went home, and the others went
          up-stairs to their rooms very quietly. They all had to pass the large
          corner room which was always given to visitors, and, although the
          light was turned very low, they could see through the half-closed door
          that Candace was trying to undress the little girl without waking her,
          and the senator, whose broad back was toward the door, was bending
          down to unbutton the little shoes, one of which he lifted and pressed
          to his lips just as the last pair of girls went by.

          Notwithstanding the earnestness with which these teachings were
          enforced, it may readily be believed that the wild barbarian, who was
          clamoring for the restoration of stolen cattle, or the angry
          relatives, eager to share the wer-gild of some murdered kinsman, would
          scarce submit to be balked of their rights at the cost of simple
          perjury on the part of the criminal. We have seen that both before and
          after their conversion to Christianity they had little scruple in
          defiling the most sacred sanctions of the oath with cunning fraud, and
          they could repose little confidence in the most elaborate devices
          which superstition could invent to render perjury more to be dreaded
          than defeat. It was therefore natural that they should perpetuate an
          ancestral custom, which had arisen from the structure of their
          society, and which derived its guarantee from the solidarity of
          families alluded to above. This was the custom which was subsequently
          known as canonical compurgation, and which long remained a part of
          English jurisprudence, under the name of the Wager of Law. The
          defendant, when denying the allegation under oath,34 appeared
          surrounded by a number of companions—juratores, conjuratores,
          sacramentales, collaudantes, compurgatores, as they were variously
          termed—who swore, not to their knowledge of the facts, but as sharers
          and partakers in the oath of denial.
